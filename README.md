**Question 1: Why do computers understand only binary language?**

Ans: Computer is an electronic device and inside the computers RAM, ROM, Hard-Disk are present. This parts are made with many electonic componentes such as register, capacitor are present.This electronics componentes have two states i.e. 'ON' state and 'OFF' state. An 'ON' state may be represent as '3 - 5' V and 'OFF' state may be represent as '0 - 1' volts.So,the data can be represented in digital electronices using a series of these ON and OFF stages. That's why we can represent the information through the series of on and off states or the combination of 0's and 1's in electronics. That's why computer only understand binary laguage.
