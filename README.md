**Question 1: Why do computers understand only binary language?**

*Ans:* Computer is an electronic device and inside the computers RAM, ROM, Hard-Disk are present. This parts are made with many electonic componentes such as registeres, capacitores etc.This electronics componentes have two states i.e. 'ON' state and 'OFF' state. An 'ON' state may be represent when the electronic circuit can experience 3 to 5 Volt and 'OFF' state may be represent when the electronic circuit can experience 0 to 1.5 Volt.So,the data can be represented in digital electronices using a series of these ON and OFF stages. That's why we can represent the information through the series of on and off states or the combination of 0's and 1's in electronics. That's why computer only understand binary laguage.

**Question 2: What is the full form of IDE?**

*Ans:* The full form of IDE is Integrated Development Environment.It is a programming environment that contains a lot of things in a single package i.e. Code Editor, Compiler, Debugger.It is actually a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to the developers need to write or test software.'

**Question 3:What is the difference between a text editor and a code editor?**

*Ans:* Text editor is used to edit text files.Example of a text editor is Notepad.

Code editor is specifically meant to edit code. They provide you with various features like auto indent, parenthesis matching, different colors for highlighting the variables, keywords, comments, pre-processor directives, strings, etc,suggestiones for syntax errors etc.Example of a text editor is Notepad++.

**Question 4:What are the steps to develop software using the C language?**

*Ans:* There are mainly two steps:

**Step 1:** Create a Source file with extension (.c), where we can write all the logics required for doing a particular task.

**Step 2:** Compile or build the Source file. First Compiler take the source code file and Errors cheacking process are done. Then if there are no errors are found in the source code then the source code goes to preprocessor and the preprocessor attach all header files code with our source code and generate an intermediate file and stores it as a file with extension (.i).After that this intermediate file converted into object code and stores it as a file with extension (.obj).Then the object code is given to the Linker. The Linker combines both the object code and specified header file code and generates an Executable file with a (.exe) extension.

**Question 5:What is the latest version of C Language?**

*Ans:* The latest version of the C language is C17 released in 2018.

**Question 6:Who developed C Language?**

*Ans:* C language developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at AT&T (American Telephone & Telegraph) bell laboratories.

**Question 7:What is the difference between System and Application Software?**

*Ans:* System Software is the type of software which is the interface between application software and system. Whereas Application Software is the type of software which runs as per user request. It runs on the platform which is provide by system software.

System software is used for operating computer hardware.WhereasApplication software is used by user to perform specific task such as playing music or movie, editing text file,open pictures etc.

**Question 8:How to convert a number from a decimal number system to a binary number system?**

*Ans:* There are mainly five steps:

**Step 1:** Take decimal number as dividend.

**Step 2:** Divide this number by 2. As 2 is base of binary number system so divisor here.

**Step 3:** Store the remainder in an array. These remainderes mainly 0's and 1's. Because, we divide the number by 2.

**Step 4:** Repeat the above two steps until the number is greater than zero.

**Step 5:** Print the array in reverse order. This is equivalent binary number of given decimal number.
